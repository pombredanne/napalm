Participating
_____________


Before the event
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Feel free to navigate all the repos on the `napalm automation <https://github.com/napalm-automation>`_ organization and find issues you might want to work on.

  #. If you find any feel free to comment on the issue to let the organizers know.
  #. If you don't and you know what you would like to work on, please, create an issue with the description of what you want to achieve.
  #. If you want to participate and you don't know what to do, feel free to ask on the slack channel. It is already available so go there and ask.

During the event
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

  #. Make sure you are on slack. We will use that as our main communications channel. We will make all the announcements there and we will notify you there if we plan to make some announcement on the hangout.
  #. If you can't attend the live videos don't sweat. They will be published on YouTube as soon as they are done so you don't miss anything.
  #. If you are in New Zealand and think you live on a strange timezone and, thus, you can't participate, you are wrong. GitHub is great for asynchronous communications and I am sure there will always be someone around on slack to help you through any problem you might encounter, to help someone yourself or simply to wind up for a second and just talk about any random topic you want.
