Mentors
_______

.. important::
    All levels of expertise are welcome so if you are new to github, python, napalm or even to networking, don't let that be on the way. We have some :doc:`mentors <mentors>` to help you and plenty of tasks to get you started with python, github, and various other tools for testing code, making it look pretty, etc. So if you are looking for some free training this might be a good way to get it ;)


The community in networkToCode is pretty much great so if you have any problem just post it on the slack channel. Feel free to also ping any of the mentors if you didn't get any satisfactory answer.

Mentors' slack handles are:

 * ``dbarroso``
 * ``mirceaulinic``
 * ``ggabriele``
