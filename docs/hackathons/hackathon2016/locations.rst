The hackathon will be held online. We will use slack as the main communications channel, github to coordinate the work and hangouts for live presentations, which will be posted online on a youtbe channel within the hour.

Check this :ref:`link <hackathon2016-useful-information>` for more information regarding the slack channel, hangouts, youtube, etc..

IRL Gatherings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Apparently there is something called real life and people like to gather in groups, shocking, isn't it? We will gather in some locations just for the sake of feeling the warmth of other human beings and probably have beer after a long day of hacking. This is completely optional and unofficial, although, if you want to host a physical meetup I will be happy to announce it here.
