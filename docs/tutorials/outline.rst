Outline
=======

This tutorial gets you up-and-running quickly with NAPALM in a local virtual environment so you can see it in action in under an hour.  We'll cover the following:

#. Installing the required tools
#. Creating a virtual lab with an Arista device
#. Manually applying configuration to the device using NAPALM
#. Driving NAPALM through Python code

.. note::  This tutorial does not cover fully automated configuration management (e.g., using NAPALM in conjunction with Ansible, Chef, Salt, etc.).  We hope that tutorials for these tools will be contributed soon so that you can evaluate the options for your particular environment.
