Installation
============

Tools
-----

You'll need a few tools:

* Python
* `pip <https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/>`_: The PyPA recommended tool for installing Python packages
* `VirtualBox <https://www.virtualbox.org/>`_: a software virtualization tool
* `Vagrant <https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html>`_: a command line utility for managing the lifecycle of virtual machines

As the focus of this tutorial is NAPALM, we don't even scratch the surface of these tools.  If you're not familiar with them, please do some research [#f1]_ as they will be an important part of your development/ops toolkit.

Install
-------

Install NAPALM with pip::

    pip install napalm


.. [#f1] Vagrant's `getting started guide <https://www.vagrantup.com/docs/getting-started/>`_ is worth reading and working through.
